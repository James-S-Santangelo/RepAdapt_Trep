YOUR DATA HERE:	rawg0003	"This pipeline analyses 1,992 white clover (Trifolium repens) samples from 26 cities around the world. From each city, we sampled between 5 and 10 plants (mean = 8.66) from each of 1 to 5 urban and rural populations (mean = 4.42). This pipeline includes the following analysis steps:

Estimate allele frequencies at SNPs across all 1,992 samples
For each SNP in (1), re-estimate allele counts and frequencies in each population of each city independently.
For population from every city, estimate pi, Waterson's theta, and Tajima's D in 20 Kb windows across the genome.
For each city, estimate pairwise urban-rural Hudson's Fst in 20 Kb windows across the genome. Done for all pairwise urban-rural population combinations."	white clover | urbanization | wgs	https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mec.17311 | https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abk0989 | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-025-02751-2	UofT		Permits Not Required	marc.johnson@utoronto.ca | james.santangelo@berkeley.edu | pbattlay@gmail.com | kathryn.hodgins@monash.edu
